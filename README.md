Fashionable meditations
=======================

This is the source code to ‘fashionable meditations’, a facebook application that generates status messages that strike a balance between the ridiculous and the sublime. The algorithm is said to take into account your individuality, and has been based on drafts for an artist’s statement.

The working example is hosted at:

[http://apps.facebook.com/ericupdates/](http://apps.facebook.com/ericupdates/)

You can also check out the [application page](http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=109473415757811).


Usage
-----

You can do what you like with this code, except for the sentences: I choose to reserve my righs over them (they are ‘free as in beer’). You can either use them as a whole, or scrap them out for other sentences. This has to do with the nature of my project, where I am trying to figure out if my individual voice can exist without my identity—the words are the ‘individual part’ that has to stay in place for the experiment to work.

If you want to host your own copy, you need an API key. Make a developer’s account and set up an application at Facebook. This will provide you with the necessary keys. If you just want to contribute changes, you will see them applied to the running version as mentioned above.

Contribute
----------

More
----

The [I like tight pants and software development](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=351529663708) group is where it is at. If you do not like Facebook, I wholly agree, centralised services should be something of the past. I hope something like [Onesocialweb](http://onesocialweb.org) takes off.
